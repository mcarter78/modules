## Summary

We are going to refactor the code for our microblog using Bootstrap, jQuery and localStorage (if you haven't done that already).

Skills:

- Use localStorage to persist data
- Use jQuery to manipulate the DOM
- Use Bootstrap to make it prettier

### Make it go!
It's up to you but the best approach here may be to start from scratch. Take your time and make it go!

### Make it awesomer!
Why stop with a microblog? Can you build out your form to add some unique functionality? Go for it!
